### Kingdom of Thobam

**Background:**
- Mining Kingdom
-	Controls the ancient dwarven mines of Velorria which connects many smaller mines to the main shaft and facilitates an orderly extraction of ores.
-	Gives thanks to the mountains as their source of provision, all while maintaining a healthy respect for the power of quakes/tremors and their ability to close off shafts (If a mine collapses due to a tremor, that mine is abandoned as a sign of the mountain’s displeasure).

**Terrain:**
-	City is located high in the Eastern Bastrel Mountains.
-	Deep cave complexes underneath the mines of Velorria.

**Politics:**
- Capitalism
- Ruled by a council of noble families.
- Families are represented by a patriarch who designates his successor (not always the patriarch’s son).
- Relative influence and power are determined by each family’s mining output.
- When mines from different families intersect or claim the same ore vein, the council intervenes and determines ownership.
- Non-noble families and individuals make up much of the labor force while the noble family members act as overseers and other educated positions.
- Is cordial with Holgotir. They trade metals and gems for tools/food.
